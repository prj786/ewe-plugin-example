# ewe-plugin-example

The reference plugin for [ewe](https://github.com/prj786/ewe) — copy it to
start your own. Three entry points, one file each:

| kind | file | shows |
|---|---|---|
| `service` | `Service.qml` | a headless object: logs the shell version and accent via `Globals` and `Theme` |
| `panel` | `Panel.qml` | a `PanelWindow` with its own `IpcHandler` — `qs ipc call example.hello toggle` |
| `bar-widget` | `Widget.qml` | an `Item` the bar packs like a built-in indicator, click opens Settings |

```sh
ewe-plugin add https://github.com/prj786/ewe-plugin-example.git --enable
qs ipc call example.hello toggle
ewe-plugin remove example.hello
```

To make it yours: change `id` in `manifest.json` to `<your-namespace>.<name>`
(lowercase, `ewe.` is reserved), edit, and `ewe-plugin validate .`. The
manifest fields, the kinds, what the shell exposes as public API and the
safe-mode rules are in ewe's [docs/PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/prj786/ewe/blob/main/docs/PLUGINS.md).

Plugins run unsandboxed inside the shell process. Keep yours small and
honest, and so will everyone who reads it before enabling it.
